steps to complete

//cloudinary overlay to put image on top of template 
//algorithm that sends yosemite images to one template and grand canyon images to another
//error handling/message if image does not fit either
//button to share images
//button to start over 



//if probability is .96> and <1, it fits the location and should be linked to that locations filter

//if it doesnt hit that probability of either location, return message "cant find location" OR have it be a generic filter with a greeting

//design and implement filter and front end for displaying it




//alternatively 

//create two react components with containers that can accept an src tag
//algorithm will send the image to one container or another
//fix css so that image it sent to back, opacity up, rei logo in bottom corner, name of place on top of image
