# REI Adventure Postcard

## Capture and share beautiful moments with intelligent software

The REI Adventure Postcard mobile app uses data collected from the REI National Parks app and trains the Einstein Platform Vision AI to recognize outdoor adventure destinations promoted by REI. By capturing and recording data on these famous national parks and outdoor retreats, this app is able to provide adventure lovers with the ability to instantly send a virtual postcard to their friends and loved ones, with just the click of a button. 

## The Idea:

This idea was inspired by the vision to take passions and hobbies, and make them even better with technology. But that's just the beginning. With the ability to track certain locations their users favorite, REI will have the ability to predict product trends and seasonal needs, as well as make informed suggestions to their users on gear and services that could help give them a unique and fullfilled experience.
